# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
<br>

**📌 Project Overview**

Customer segmentation is a crucial step for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this project, I implemented **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm,which uses **Pattern clustering** method to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information.

This helps businesses:

-Identify high-value customers.

-Personalize marketing campaigns.

-Improve customer retention.

-Increase overall profitability.
