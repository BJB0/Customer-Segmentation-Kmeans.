# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
<br>

**📌 Project Overview**

Customer segmentation is a crucial step for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this project, I implemented **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information.

This helps businesses:

Identify high-value customers.

Personalize marketing campaigns.

Improve customer retention.

Increase overall profitability.

**📊 Dataset**

The dataset contains customer details such as:

Customer ID

Age

Gender

Annual Income

Spending Score

<br>

**🚀 Implementation Steps**

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing distributions and relationships.

Feature Selection & Scaling – Choosing relevant features and applying normalization.

Applying K-Means Algorithm – Using the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters.

Customer Segmentation – Grouping customers and visualizing clusters.
